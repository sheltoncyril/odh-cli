## Notes

- Specification focuses on architectural refactoring to align with constitution v1.14.0
- All requirements are based on explicit TODO items and principles from the constitution
- Success criteria use measurable percentages and counts (100% isolation, zero violations)
- Edge cases identify potential complications during refactoring
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear from constitution directives
