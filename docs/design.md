# Design: odh-cli

This document describes the architecture and design decisions for the odh-cli kubectl plugin.

For development guidelines, coding conventions, and contribution practices, see [development.md](development.md).

## Overview

CLI tool for ODH (Open Data Hub) and RHOAI (Red Hat OpenShift AI) for interacting with ODH/RHOAI deployments on Kubernetes. The CLI is designed as a kubectl plugin to provide a familiar kubectl-like experience.

## Installation and Usage

### Docker Container

The CLI is available as a container image with multi-platform support (linux/amd64, linux/arm64).

**Default Configuration:**
The container sets `KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig` by default. Mount your local kubeconfig to this path:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti \
  -v $KUBECONFIG:/kubeconfig \
  quay.io/lburgazzoli/odh-cli:latest lint
```

**Custom Path:**
Override the KUBECONFIG environment variable if needed:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti \
  -v $KUBECONFIG:/custom/path \
  -e KUBECONFIG=/custom/path \
  quay.io/lburgazzoli/odh-cli:latest lint
```

### kubectl Plugin

Install the `kubectl-odh` binary to your PATH for kubectl integration:

```bash
kubectl odh lint
kubectl odh version
```

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Core Principles
- **Extensible Command Structure**: Modular design allowing easy addition of new commands
- **Consistent Output**: Unified output formats (table, JSON) across all commands
- **kubectl Integration**: Native kubectl plugin providing familiar UX patterns

### Client Strategy
- Uses `controller-runtime/pkg/client` instead of `kubernetes.Interface`
- Better support for ODH and RHOAI custom resources
- Unified interface for standard and custom Kubernetes objects
- Simplifies interaction with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

## Architecture & Design

The `odh` CLI is a standalone Go application that leverages the `client-go` library to communicate with the Kubernetes API server. It is designed to function as a kubectl plugin.

### kubectl Plugin Mechanism

The CLI is named `kubectl-odh`. When the binary is placed in a directory listed in the user's `PATH`, kubectl will automatically discover it, allowing it to be invoked as `kubectl odh`. The CLI relies on the user's active kubeconfig file for cluster authentication, just like kubectl.

### Core Libraries

- **Cobra**: To build a robust command-line interface with commands, subcommands, and flags
- **Viper**: For potential future configuration needs
- **Kubernetes client-go**: The official Go client library for interacting with the Kubernetes API
- **controller-runtime/client**: A higher-level client to simplify interactions with Custom Resources
- **k8s.io/cli-runtime**: Provides standard helpers for building kubectl-like command-line tools, handling common flags and client configuration

### Command Structure

The CLI is structured using Cobra with an extensible subcommand architecture:

```
kubectl odh
├── lint [-o|--output <format>] [--target-version <version>] [--checks <selector>]
└── version
```

**Common Elements:**
- **odh** (root command): The entry point for the plugin
- **lint**: Validates cluster configuration (current state) or upgrade readiness (with --target-version)
- **-o, --output** (flag): Specifies the output format. Supported values: `table` (default), `json`, `yaml`
- **--target-version** (flag): Target version for upgrade assessment
- **--checks** (flag): Filter checks by category, group, or name
- **version**: Displays the CLI version information

**Extensibility:**
New commands can be added by implementing the command pattern with Cobra. Each command can define its own subcommands, flags, and execution logic while leveraging shared components like the output formatters and Kubernetes client.

**Note:** The lint command operates cluster-wide and does not support namespace filtering via `--namespace` flag.

### Command Implementation Pattern

Commands follow a consistent pattern separating command definition from business logic.

#### Command Lifecycle

Each command implements a four-phase lifecycle:

1. **AddFlags**: Register command-specific flags
2. **Complete**: Initialize runtime state (client, namespace, parsing)
3. **Validate**: Verify all required options are set correctly
4. **Run**: Execute command business logic

Commands use a `Command` struct (not `Options`) with constructor `NewCommand()` (not `NewOptions()`).

**Typical Structure:**
```go
type Command struct {
    shared        *SharedOptions
    targetVersion string
}

func NewCommand(opts CommandOptions) *Command {
    return &Command{
        shared:        opts.Shared,
        targetVersion: opts.TargetVersion,
    }
}

func (c *Command) AddFlags(fs *pflag.FlagSet) { /* register flags */ }
func (c *Command) Complete() error { /* initialize client, parse inputs */ }
func (c *Command) Validate() error { /* validate configuration */ }
func (c *Command) Run(ctx context.Context) error { /* execute business logic */ }
```

See [architecture.md](architecture.md#command-lifecycle) for detailed lifecycle documentation.

## Output Formats

The CLI supports multiple output formats to accommodate different use cases. Commands should implement support for these formats using the shared printer components.

### Table Output (Default)

The table output is designed for human consumption and provides a quick, readable summary. The format adapts to each command's data structure. Icons and colors can be used for clarity where appropriate.

### JSON Output (`-o json`)

The JSON output is designed for scripting and integration with other tools. The structure varies by command but maintains consistency in formatting. Each command defines its own JSON structure based on its specific needs.

### YAML Output (`-o yaml`)

Similar to JSON output, the YAML format provides machine-readable output in YAML syntax, suitable for configuration files and human review.

## Lint Command

The `lint` command validates OpenShift AI cluster configuration and assesses upgrade readiness.

**DiagnosticResult Structure and Check Framework:**
The lint command uses a check framework with DiagnosticResult CR-like structures. For details, see:
- [lint/architecture.md](lint/architecture.md) - Lint command architecture
- [lint/writing-checks.md](lint/writing-checks.md) - Writing lint checks

## Project Structure

A standard Go CLI project structure is used, drawing inspiration from `sample-cli-plugin`.

```
/odh-cli
├── cmd/
│   ├── version/        # Version command
│   └── main.go         # Entry point
├── pkg/
│   ├── printer/        # Shared output formatting
│   └── util/           # Shared utilities (client, discovery, etc.)
├── internal/
│   └── version/        # Internal version information
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── Makefile
```

**Key Directories:**
- `cmd/`: Command definitions and entry points
- `pkg/`: Public packages that implement command logic and shared utilities
- `internal/`: Internal packages not intended for external use

New commands can be added under `cmd/` with their implementation logic in `pkg/` following the established patterns.

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Use cli-runtime**: Leverage `k8s.io/cli-runtime/pkg/genericclioptions` for standard kubectl flag handling
2. **Follow kubectl patterns**: Study existing kubectl plugins for consistent UX patterns
3. **Error handling**: Ensure graceful failure and meaningful error messages when ODH/RHOAI components are not available
4. **Extensibility**: Design commands to be modular and easy to add or modify
5. **Testing**: Include both unit tests and integration tests with fake Kubernetes clients
6. **Shared components**: Maximize code reuse through shared utilities like output formatters and client factories
